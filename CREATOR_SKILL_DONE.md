- Optional field (won't break existing IOUs)

### **2. CreateIOU Form** ✅
- Added "Your Skill" input field
- Placeholder: "e.g., Web Development, Graphic Design..."
- Helper text: "This is what you'll provide when someone redeems your IOU"
- Defaults to "General Services" if empty

### **3. Marketplace Display** ✅

## 🎯 **HOW IT WORKS NOW:**

### **Tim Creates IOU:**
```
Description: "Paint my shop"
Hours: 5
Category: Basic
Your Skill: "Web Development" ← NEW!
```

### **Peter Sees in Marketplace:**
```
Paint my shop
💼 Creator offers: Web Development ← NEW!
⏱️ 5 hours | 👤 0x1234...5678 | ⭐ 100 rep
Collateral: 0.5 ETH
```

**Peter now knows:** "If I paint Tim's shop, I get an IOU worth 5 hours of Tim's web development work!"

---

## 🎬 **DEMO SCRIPT:**

**Creating IOU:**
> "Tim needs his shop painted. He creates an IOU and specifies that he offers Web Development in exchange. This way, whoever accepts knows exactly what they're getting."

**Accepting IOU:**
> "Peter sees Tim's IOU. He can see that Tim offers Web Development - perfect! Peter needs a website. So Peter paints the shop, and in return, he gets an IOU worth 5 hours of Tim's coding work."
