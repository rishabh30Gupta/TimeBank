## 🎤 **Tell Judges:**

> "We use a simple reputation system. Everyone starts with 100 reputation points, shown in the navbar with a star icon. Complete a job, both parties get +20 reputation. Default or lose a dispute, you lose -20. Higher reputation unlocks lower collateral requirements. It's simple, transparent, and easy to understand."
