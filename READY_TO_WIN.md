## 🎤 **YOUR 60-SECOND PITCH:**

> "TimeBank enables people with skills but no cash to access services now and pay with work later. We use a simple reputation system - everyone starts with 100 points, shown in the navbar. Complete a job, both parties get +20 reputation. Default, you lose -20.
>
> We deployed a working prototype on Sepolia [show Etherscan] with smart contracts for creating tradeable work IOUs and reputation tracking.
>
> Through testing, we identified a critical improvement: two-sided collateral [show V2 code]. Both parties stake equal ETH, creating mutual accountability. Disputes are resolved by admin review. False claims lose you 20 reputation.
>
> This solves the free-rider problem in P2P labor exchange and creates a fair, trustless marketplace. The gig economy is $100B+ and growing - TimeBank makes it accessible to everyone."

## 💡 **Q&A PREPARATION:**

### **Q: "Why two-sided collateral?"**
**A:** "To create mutual accountability. If only one party has risk, the other can cheat without consequence. With two-sided collateral, both parties are incentivized to deliver quality work."

### **Q: "How do you prevent false claims?"**
**A:** "False claims cost you 20 reputation points. Since reputation affects your ability to create future IOUs and your collateral requirements, there's a real cost to filing frivolous disputes."

### **Q: "What if someone has no money for collateral?"**
**A:** "Great question! In production, we'd implement reputation-based collateral reduction. High-reputation users need less collateral. We could also add peer vouching where trusted friends stake collateral for you."

### **Q: "How is this different from Fiverr?"**
**A:** "Fiverr requires upfront payment. TimeBank lets you promise future work in exchange for services now. It's also fully decentralized - no company in the middle taking fees."

### **Q: "What's the business model?"**
**A:** "Small transaction fees (1-2%), premium features like priority matching, and enterprise licensing. The gig economy is $100B+ and growing."
