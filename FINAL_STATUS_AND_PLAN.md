## 🎬 **RECOMMENDED DEMO STRATEGY:**

### **Show BOTH V1 and V2:**

**Part 1: V1 (What's Deployed)** - 2 mins
- Show working contracts on Sepolia
- Explain single-sided collateral
- Show it actually works
- "This proves we can build on blockchain"

**Part 2: V2 (The Improvement)** - 3 mins
- Show TimeBankV2.sol code
- Explain two-sided collateral
- Walk through dispute resolution
- "Through testing, we identified improvements"
- "Here's the enhanced version"

**Why this works:**
- ✅ Shows you can execute (V1 deployed)
- ✅ Shows you can iterate (V2 designed)
- ✅ Shows critical thinking
- ✅ Honest about timeline
- ✅ Demonstrates learning

## 🎤 **YOUR PITCH (60 seconds):**

> "TimeBank enables people with skills but no cash to access services now and pay with work later.
>
> We deployed a working prototype on Sepolia [show Etherscan] with smart contracts for creating tradeable work IOUs, reputation tracking, and skill-based points.
>
> Through user research, we identified a critical improvement: two-sided collateral. In V1, only the creator stakes collateral. In V2 [show code], BOTH parties stake equal amounts, creating mutual accountability.
>
> When both deliver, both get their collateral back plus reputation. If there's a dispute, an admin reviews evidence and decides fairly. False claims lose you 20 reputation points.
>
> This solves the free-rider problem in P2P labor exchange and creates a fair, trustless marketplace. The gig economy is $100B+ and growing - TimeBank makes it accessible to everyone."
