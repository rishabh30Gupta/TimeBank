## 🎯 **Your Pitch (30 seconds):**

> "TimeBank solves the free-rider problem in P2P labor exchange. We use a two-sided collateral system where both parties stake ETH, creating mutual accountability. When work is delivered, both get their collateral back plus reputation points. Disputes are resolved by admin review. False claims are penalized with -20 reputation. This makes the system fair, secure, and trustworthy. It's deployed on Sepolia and fully functional."

## 🎥 **Video Script (3 minutes):**

### **0:00 - 0:30: Hook**
"TimeBank enables people with skills but no cash to access services now and pay with work later. It's Uber for skills, but you pay with promises instead of money."

### **0:30 - 1:00: Problem**
"The challenge is trust. How do you ensure both parties deliver? Traditional platforms only protect one side. We protect both."

### **1:00 - 2:00: Solution**
"TimeBank V2 uses two-sided collateral. Both the work provider and requester stake equal ETH. When both deliver, both get their money back plus reputation. If there's a dispute, an admin reviews and decides fairly. False claims lose you reputation."

### **2:00 - 2:30: Demo**
[Show Etherscan, contracts, key functions]

### **2:30 - 3:00: Impact**
"This creates a fair, trustless marketplace for labor exchange. Students, gig workers, anyone with skills can participate. The gig economy is $100B+ and growing. TimeBank makes it accessible to everyone."
