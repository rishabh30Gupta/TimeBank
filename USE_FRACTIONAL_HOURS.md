# ✅ SOLUTION: Use Fractional Hours!

## 🔧 **The Problem:**

The smart contract requires **10 ETH per hour** as collateral.
- You have: **0.31 ETH**
- For 2 hours: Need **20 ETH** ❌
- You don't have enough!

## ✅ **The Solution:**

Use **fractional hours** (decimals)!

### **Example:**
- **0.01 hours** = 0.6 minutes = Need **0.1 ETH** ✅
- **0.02 hours** = 1.2 minutes = Need **0.2 ETH** ✅
- **0.03 hours** = 1.8 minutes = Need **0.3 ETH** ✅

## 💡 **Why This Works:**

| Hours | Collateral | You Have | Status |
|-------|-----------|----------|--------|
| 0.01  | 0.1 ETH   | 0.31 ETH | ✅ OK  |
| 0.02  | 0.2 ETH   | 0.31 ETH | ✅ OK  |
| 0.03  | 0.3 ETH   | 0.31 ETH | ✅ OK  |
| 0.04  | 0.4 ETH   | 0.31 ETH | ❌ Too much |
| 2.00  | 20 ETH    | 0.31 ETH | ❌ Way too much |

---

## 🎯 **Recommended for Testing:**

**Use 0.02 hours** - This gives you:
- Collateral: 0.2 ETH ✅
- Leaves you: 0.11 ETH for more tests
- Can create 1-2 more IOUs

---

## 📝 **Note:**

This is just for **testing on Sepolia**. In production, you'd either:
1. Use a different collateral amount in the contract
2. Have users with more test ETH
3. Use a stablecoin instead of ETH
