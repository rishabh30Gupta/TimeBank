## 💬 **WHAT TO TELL JUDGES:**

> "In the MVP, we focused on the core innovation: two-sided collateral and dispute resolution. We recognize that different skills have different values - that's why in V2, we'll implement skill-based multipliers and clear exchange terms. For this hackathon, we prioritized proving the collateral concept works."

**Judges will respect:**
- ✅ Your prioritization
- ✅ Your honesty
- ✅ Your clear roadmap
- ✅ Your working MVP

---

## 🏆 **YOU'LL WIN BECAUSE:**

1. ✅ **Working demo** (everything functions)
2. ✅ **Innovation** (two-sided collateral is unique)
3. ✅ **Execution** (professional UI, deployed contracts)
4. ✅ **Presentation** (clear, honest, well-prepared)

**NOT because you have every feature!**
