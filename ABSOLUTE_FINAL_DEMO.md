## 💡 **TELL JUDGES:**

### **About Auto-Completion:**
> "For the demo, I'm auto-simulating the other party confirming after 3 seconds. In production, each party clicks their own button. This lets me show the complete flow quickly."

### **About Random Disputes:**
> "The dispute system randomly decides outcomes to demonstrate both scenarios. In production, an admin would review actual evidence - screenshots, messages, deliverables. If the claim is valid, the guilty party loses their collateral and 20 reputation. If the claim is false, the person who filed it loses 20 reputation as a penalty to discourage frivolous disputes."

**Professional and realistic!** ✅

## 🎤 **DEMO SCRIPT:**

### **Opening:**
> "TimeBank solves the free-rider problem in P2P labor exchange using two-sided collateral and blockchain smart contracts. Let me show you how it works."

### **Create & Accept:**
> "I create an IOU promising 8 hours of work. I stake 0.8 ETH as collateral. Someone accepts by staking equal collateral. Now both parties have skin in the game."

### **Completion:**
> "When work is delivered, both parties confirm. For the demo, I'm auto-simulating the other party after 3 seconds. [Wait] There! Both confirmed. Both get collateral back plus 20 reputation."

### **Dispute:**
> "But what if there's a problem? Either party can file a dispute. An admin reviews evidence. The system randomly demonstrates both outcomes - valid claims where the guilty party is penalized, and false claims where the filer is penalized. This discourages frivolous disputes."

### **Closing:**
> "This creates a fair, trustless marketplace for labor exchange. The gig economy is $100B+ and growing. TimeBank makes it accessible to everyone, regardless of financial status."
