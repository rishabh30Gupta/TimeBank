3. Show success message

## 💡 **KEY TALKING POINTS:**

### **1. Two-Sided Collateral**
> "Both parties stake equal collateral. This creates mutual accountability - both have skin in the game."

### **2. Dual Confirmation**
> "Both must confirm completion. Prevents one-sided claims. For demo, auto-simulating after 3 seconds."

### **3. Dispute Resolution**
> "Fair admin review with evidence. False claims penalized -20 reputation. For demo, auto-resolving after 4 seconds."

### **4. Reputation System**
> "Simple: 100 start, +20 per completion, -20 per default. Higher rep = lower collateral."

### **5. Complete Flow**
> "Create → Accept → Deliver → Confirm → Complete. All automated for demo, but in production each party controls their own actions."
